### An analysis of green energy stocks for a fictional financial advisor

## Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to show the yearly returns of a selection of green energy stock. My fictional client is looking to advise his parents on stock options, and they have decided to invest in green energy companies. Their favorite stock is DQ, but they chose this for sentimental reasons so are there other stocks that would give them a better financial return? 

To determine this, I want to run a basic analysis over multiple stocks. This has the added benefit of understanding looped code, as well as refactoring code for faster results. Faster results are important because our data sample right now is small, but the user could want to plug in exponentially larger data sets, which take longer to loop through.
